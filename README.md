# Football Player Transfer Value Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict and analyze factors influencing football players' transfer values in the top 5 European leagues. By leveraging historic advanced statistics and machine learning techniques, we seek to uncover patterns in market valuations and provide insights for football clubs to optimize their transfer strategies.

## Objectives
- Identify key factors affecting player transfer values
- Develop a predictive model for player valuations
- Assist football clubs in budget control and strategic player acquisitions/sales

## Data Source
- Kaggle dataset (Varma S. 2022)
- Data from transfermarkt.co.uk and fbref.com
- Covers players in top 5 European leagues from 2017/18 to 2020/2021 seasons

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analysis by player nationality
   - Analysis by player position
   - Analysis by league affiliation
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Development**
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Bagging Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor

## Key Analyses
- Impact of nationality on player valuation
- Influence of player position on market value
- Effect of league affiliation on transfer prices

## Potential Applications
